## Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install and setup Ollama:**
   - Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
   - Pull the required model:
     ```bash
     ollama pull gpt-oss-120b
     ```

3. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --interface cli
   ```

## Usage

### CLI Interface
```bash
python main.py --interface cli
```

### Desktop Interface
```bash
python main.py --interface desktop
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
python main.py --debug
```

## AI Agents

- **Story Agent**: Manages narrative progression and plot development
- **NPC Agent**: Handles non-player character behavior and dialogue
- **Environment Agent**: Manages locations, atmosphere, and world state
- **Rule Agent**: Interprets game rules and mechanics
- **Memory Agent**: Maintains continuity and game history

## Configuration

The game uses a JSON configuration file for settings:
- AI model parameters
- Game difficulty settings
- Interface preferences
- Logging configuration

## Ultra-Think System

The Ultra-Think system provides deep, multi-layered analysis for complex gaming situations, enhancing the AI's ability to handle intricate horror scenarios with nuanced understanding.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Mode Analysis**: Different thinking modes for various scenario types:
  - `HORROR_ATMOSPHERE`: Atmospheric and environmental horror enhancement
  - `CHARACTER_PSYCHOLOGY`: Deep character motivation and psychological analysis  
  - `MYTHOS_INTEGRATION`: Cosmic horror elements and forbidden knowledge
  - `CONSEQUENCE_ANALYSIS`: Long-term impact assessment of actions and decisions
  - `NARRATIVE_FLOW`: Story pacing and dramatic structure optimization
  - `TENSION_BUILDING`: Dramatic tension and suspense management

- **Coordinated Agent Analysis**: Multiple AI agents collaborate through the Ultra-Think Coordinator to provide comprehensive scenario analysis

- **Adaptive Complexity**: Automatically triggers for complex situations requiring deeper reasoning

- **Cthulhu-Specific Patterns**: Specialized analysis patterns for cosmic horror themes

### Usage Example

```bash
# Test the Ultra-think integration
python test_ultra_think_integration.py

# Run an example scenario demonstration  
python example_ultra_think_scenario.py
```

### Integration

Each AI agent automatically uses Ultra-think when encountering complex situations:

- **Story Agent**: Multi-scenario plot analysis, climax optimization, long-term narrative impact
- **NPC Agent**: Complex social interactions, psychological profiling, group dynamics  
- **Environment Agent**: Atmospheric optimization, multi-sensory horror experiences
- **Rule Agent**: Ambiguous rule interpretation, balanced challenge design
- **Memory Agent**: Continuity analysis, pattern recognition, story arc optimization

The GM Brain coordinates these analyses to provide enhanced, coherent responses that maintain narrative flow while maximizing horror impact.
